DESCRIPTION

this program is intended to draw clouds during twilight. the first four brushes help facilitate the values of the clouds you will be drawing, varying between warm and cool tones for the clouds in that specific light. the other two are a dark and light pen, which allow you to draw details or characters -- whatever you like. i was inspired by los angeles sunsets.
